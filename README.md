# Writing Efficient Code with Pandas

The goal is to be able to apply a function to data based on a feature value, iterate through big datasets rapidly, and manipulate data belonging to different groups efficiently. 
Working with a small amount of data, we often donâ€™t realize how slow code execution can be. Building efficient built-in pandas functions to perform tasks faster,  like targeting specific entries and features from the data, to the most complex tasks, like applying functions on groups of entries, much faster than Python's usual methods.
